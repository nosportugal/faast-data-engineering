> **Note**: NYC TLC changed the format of the data we use to parquet. But you can still access the csv files [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data). Alternatively, you can use the original parquet files at NYC TLC's [website](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) and then adapt your code to read parquets instead of csv.

> **Warning**: At some points in the videos and code, you may see data being downloaded from an Amazon S3 bucket. This bucket, however, is no longer accessible. Please use the [GitHub backup](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data) instead.
